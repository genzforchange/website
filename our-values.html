            <p>The climate crisis, fueled by corporate greed, is here and destroying communities nationwide. Our failure
              to combat this emergency will result in scarce resources and dramatically increased impact of
              not-so-natural disasters. We and future generations deserve a livable future with clean air, safe water,
              affordable energy, and thriving communities.</p>
            <p><b>Our current economy places profits ahead of people’s wellbeing. Our economy must be reimagined to
                ensure the planet and people come first.</b></p>
            <p>This requires divesting from and enforcing a full phase out of fossil fuels while securing a transition
              for workers and communities dependent on this economy. Our vision of a green America includes investments
              in publicly-owned clean energy and the expansion of public goods such as green spaces, public transit and
              green social housing. Our country must wholly commit to climate goals that align with international
              benchmarks to secure a bright, safe future for everyone.</p>

            <h2>Housing</h2>
            <p><b>A third of Gen Z live at home because they can’t afford rent, while over half of renters spend more
                than 30% of their income on housing. Meanwhile, private equity firms (*cough* Blackstone) profit by
                hoarding the housing supply, forcing people to rent price-gouged properties.</b></p>
            <p><b>We need to end the private sector’s monopoly on housing.</b> The government must require sales of
              newly built or vacant housing to the public and apply antitrust laws to monopolies that trap individuals
              in permanent renters’ markets. We need a ‘Federal Green Social Housing Development Authority’ to build and
              preserve millions of affordable housing units nationwide. Developers should not receive low-interest loans
              without affordability guarantees and all federal housing loans must be tied to rent caps, eviction
              protections, and safety standards.</p>
            <p>Renters need stronger protections: “good-cause” eviction laws, the right to organize, and strengthen
              habitability standards.</p>
            <p><b>Housing is a human right, not a luxury.</b></p>

            <h2>Labor</h2>
            <p>Quarter after quarter, companies reap record-breaking profits while wages stagnate and costs rise.</p>
            <p><b>Corporate profits come from our labor, yet corporations are actively undermining labor protection laws
                and union organizing.</b> We need to <b>strengthen labor protections</b> by creating comprehensive
              national pathways to unionization and increasing the power of the National Labor Relations Board to
              support workers and enforce penalties for union-busting. Additionally, exploitation must be confronted at
              all levels; Ending forced prison labor by requiring all incarcerated work is voluntary and fairly paid,
              and holding corporations accountable for their exploitation and abuse.</p>
            <p>We can <b>build an economy that values labor</b> and ensures people can thrive from the work they do.
              This means legislating fair workplace standards that guarantee paid family leave, livable wages,
              healthcare, PTO, and more. It also requires us to establish anti-discrimination protections for formerly
              incarcerated individuals and undocumented immigrants.</p>
            <p>Every person should thrive from the value of their labor.</p>

              debilitating and gun violence is the new norm.</p>
            <p><b>Public education should be safe, inclusive and fully funded.</b> To get there, we must hold gun
              manufacturers accountable, end ‘political’ censorship on curriculums, invest in media literacy and defend
              LGBTQ+ students in every classroom. We must continue to invest in K-12 schools, give teachers a liveable
              salary, and support teacher unions.</p>

            <p><b>Money should no longer buy votes.</b> Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission gave special

              Reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare are facing coordinated political attacks while our hospitals

            <h2>Dismantling systemic racism</h2>
            <p>This country was founded on slavery and genocide. <b>Systemic racism is at the core of every institution
                and must be deconstructed at every level of society.</b></p>
            <p>We must fully fund and retrofit our public schools so that the true and complete history of systemic
              racism in the U.S is taught. </p>
            <p>We must aggressively <b>reform our policing and incarceration practices,</b> end government surveillance,
              and dismantle the prison industrial complex while <b>building systems centered on restorative justice.</b>
              We need to redirect resources from police and jails to community care programs and reparations.</p>
            <p>Our <b>medical system must be reconstructed to require comprehensive anti-racism and implicit bias
                training</b> and publicly report racial disparities in medical outcomes. BIPOC communities suffer the
              intentional exposure of toxic waste, polluted air and water, and climate disasters because of extractive
              industries and government policies. We must decommission all toxic sites in BIPOC communities and fund
              community-owned renewable infrastructure. </p>
            <p>Dismantling systemic racism is a pre-requisite in the path to liberation. </p>

            <h2>Protect and Affirm the LGBTQ+ community </h2>
            <p><b>Trans youth and queer people of color are being attacked relentlessly.</b> Across the country, state
              violence, healthcare bans, and censorship are stripping rights that were earned over generations.</p>
            <p><b>We stand firmly with the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for dignity, safety, and inclusion.</b>
              Institutions and social constructs that oppress LGBTQ+ communities must be dissolved in order to achieve
              liberation. We must criminalize conversion therapy, end the censorship of LGBTQ+ topics in schools, and
              ensure every student has access to mental health resources. </p>
            <p>The LGBTQ+ community should have guaranteed access to gender affirming care in all states and investments
              in social programs that combat LGBTQ+ discrimination. Schools must also teach the true history of violence
              against the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
            <p><b>Our fight will not stop until queer and trans communities are protected, affirmed, and free.</b></p>
            <h2>End the military industrial complex</h2>
            <p><b>Freedom does not need to come at the expense of others.</b> Our military campaigns have wreaked havoc
              on foreign civilian populations, decimated precious lands and ecosystems, and produced more carbon
              emissions than entire countries. Our government has sponsored countless military coups abroad and is
              directly implicated in the ongoing Palestinian genocide. Our military industrial complex ensures that
              private interests prevail over that of the people and the planet. </p>
            <p>We need to <b>end all aid to genocidal regimes, repeal the War Powers Act, accept all refugees displaced
                by U.S.-backed wars</b> and redirect military spending toward foreign aid and the advancement of human
              rights efforts.</p>
            <p>The U.S. must join accountability systems that prioritize collective liberation in order to achieve
              international justice.</p>
            <p><b>Our government must stop fueling wars abroad and be held accountable to restoring peace for all
                communities impacted.
